Dear GPUScA Authors,

As discussed at the workshop, extended versions of the workshop papers can
be submitted to the International Journal of Computational Science and
Engineering (IJCSE) as part of the Special Issue on: GPUs and Accelerators
for Scientific Applications.

 http://www.inderscience.com/browse/callpaper.php?callID=1566

This was an open call and has already been closed. GPUScA authors can
submit to this call nonetheless. Authors submit directly via Inderscience
submission system, referring to the SI on GPUs. In Step 1 of the submission
process, there is a "Notes" box where you should put a note that the paper
is for the SI on GPUs:

Please use:

"C. You can add a SHORT comment for the editor(s) here (for example, if the
paper is submitted for a Special Issue, you can type the name of the Guest
Editor(s)):"

to type "SI on GPUs and Accelerators for Scientific Applications. Mehofer,
Schordan, Quinlan, Di Martino".

The deadline for workshop papers is:  ***Dec 12, 2011***

For preparation of the paper and submission please take the submission
guidelines into account:

Please note that it is again a double-blind review, i.e. no author names
on the paper. Adhere strictly to the rules of the general submission system
and nominate also experts, even if for an SI some things will be handled
differently.

Since this is already the second round, it is very important that you
attach to your paper a note about how you took the reviewers comments into
account and how you modified the paper.
