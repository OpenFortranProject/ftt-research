Notes from SC'11 meeting
------------------------

- Better definition of halo concept.
- update paper to match current real API that drifted since the GPUScA paper
  was written
- replace figure 1 with something more descriptive.
- more performance experiments/numbers
- discuss where this work addresses performance-relevant things like
  ensuring that memory accesses are coalesced

DONE:

- figure to illustrate halo and index computation.  this is currently too
  vague and hard for readers to infer from text.
- describe details about the code that implements the fortran->C translator
  for kernels.  this is contained in the transformation directory of the
  opencl section of the research repo.
