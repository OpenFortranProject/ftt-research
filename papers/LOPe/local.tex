\begin{abstract}
Some stuff...

%%Emerging GPU architectures for high performance computing are well suited to a data-parallel programming model.  However, programming for these architectures currently requires learning a new language, e.g., OpenCL or CUDA, or employing OpenMP compiler directives.  This paper presents preliminary work examining how programming with a local orientation can be employed in Fortran (or using a special array library in C++) to provide simple access GPU architectures.  A locally-oriented programming model is especially useful for stencil-based codes or algorithms requiring the application of convolution kernels.  In this programming model, a programmer codes the algorithm {\it only} for a single array element, but has read-only access to a small sub-array surrounding the given array element, so that a stencil can be applied.  We demonstrate how a locally-oriented programming model can be adopted using source-to-source program transformations in conjuction with a compiler-based infrastructure like ROSE.

\section{Conclusions}

Some stuff...

%%The sheer complexity of programming for clusters of many or multi-core processors with tens of millions threads of execution makes the simplicity of the data-parallel model attractive.  The increasing complexity of today's applications (especially in light of the increasing complexity of the hardware) and the need for portability across architectures make a higher-level and simpler programming model like data-parallel attractive.

%%The goal of this work has been to exploit source-to-source transformations that allow programmers to develop and maintain programs at a high-level of abstraction, without coding to a specific hardware architecture.  Furthermore these transformations allow multiple hardware architectures to be targeted without changing the high-level source.  It also removes the necessity for application programmers to understand details of the accelerator architecture or to know OpenCL.
