\section{Motivation}

The concepts in this paper were motivated by problems encountered during
the development of PetaVision, a C++ software framework designed for simulating
large networks of spiking neurons in the visual cortex of primates.  PetaVision
was designed to run on massively parallel hardware architectures and a primitive
version of PetaVision achieved over a Petaflop of sustained single precision
performance on Roadrunner, the fastest computer in the world for a brief
period of time.

TODO: Describe neural layers, spiking neurons, synaptic connections, weights,
and plasticity. Cite Heubel.

TODO: If space allows, give a simple 1D figure of connections within a neural network.
Describe the size of visual cortex in terms of the number of neurons,
the number of synaptic connections, and performance.  Reference SC Gorden Bell
paper from IBM.

TODO: Explain difficulties encountered.
