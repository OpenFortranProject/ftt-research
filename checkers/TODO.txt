Ideas for new checkers.  The names of the checkers should be
changed where a better name is appropriate.

see http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~szymansk/OOF90/bugs.html

implicitInterface
- Test to see if a procedure call has an implicit interface.

targetVariableHiding
- Test to see if a module variable is hidden when a variable
  the same name is given the target attribute.  The problem is
  that a new variable is created in the current scope masking
  the original variable.

variableRedeclaration
- Test to see if a variable is declared that hides an existing
  variable.  Example

  real :: x
  block
    integer :: x
  end block
