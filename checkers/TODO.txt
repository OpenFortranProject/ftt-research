Ideas for new checkers.  The names of the checkers should be
changed where a better name is appropriate.

-----------------------------------------
2012.1.12 - Check that Fortran BIND(C) interface is consistent with
the equivalent C function declaration.  This came up in a talk I gave
on lanuage interoperability in X division.  It would be a very nice
use of ROSE's multiple language capability.  I would use it to check
that the MPI-3 Fortran bindings are correct.

Fortran.3.x.2 Description of the vulnerability

The lower bound of every dimension of an array expression is 1.

The index of the first character of a character expression is 1.

Fortran.3.x.3 Avoiding and mitigating the vulnerability

- Always offset the result of calculating an index within an array
section by one less than the lower bound of the section.

- Always offset the result of calculating the position of a character
within a character string by the index of the first character in the
string.

XYH should be "Invalid pointer dereferencing"
-----------------------------------------

implicitInterface
- Test to see if a procedure call has an implicit interface.

targetVariableHiding
- Test to see if a module variable is hidden when a variable
  the same name is given the target attribute.  The problem is
  that a new variable is created in the current scope masking
  the original variable.

variableRedeclaration
- Test to see if a variable is declared that hides an existing
  variable.  Example

  real :: x
  block
    integer :: x
  end block
