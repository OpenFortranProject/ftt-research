These files are part of the ForOpenCL toolset.  ForOpenCL is a set
tools and Fortran bindings for OpenCL that enable the parallel
acceleration of Fortran codes for GPUs and multi-core CPUs.
ForOpenCL uses ROSE (http://rosecompiler.org/) to transform
Fortran elemental functions to OpenCL kernels.  ForOpenCL also
defines Fortran interfaces to the OpenCL runtime.

directories:
    c  - C utilities
  f90  - Fortran code implementing the OpenCL bindings

files:
  f90/forcl.f90         - a file demonstrating the OpenCL bindings
  f90/elemental_add.cl  - the OpenCL kernel called from forcl.f90

There is a makefile in the f90 directory for building forcl.
Currently it has only been tested on Mac OS X using the Intel
fortran compiler (v11.1 release 089).
