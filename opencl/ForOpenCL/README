                          DESCRIPTION
                          -----------

ForOpenCL provides Fortran interfaces to the OpenCL runtime.  It also
provides a number of wrapper classes that make using the runtime easier.
It is pretty immature at this stage.

ForOpenCL is part of the Open Fortran Parser (OFP) project.

                            RESOURCES
                            ---------

Installation instructions:

  - Edit the Makefile to provide the path to the NVIDIA SDK for Linux
    installations.  Then run make.  On Mac OSX, just run make.  Make will
    build the ForOpenCL objects and an example application, elemental_add.

Documentation:

  - None at the moment (sorry).

Running the example:

  - After running make, run the example by typing,

        ./elemental_add

Help:

  - Please send requests and suggestions for improvement to Craig Rasmussen
    <crasmussen@lanl.gov>.

TODO:

  - a configure script to build the ForOpenCL library
  - documentation
  - further simplification of the ForOpenCL API (the memory buffer usage
    is clumsy)
